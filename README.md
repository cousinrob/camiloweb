This is CamiloWeb, an interactive website for practicing skills in English as a second or other language.
It will mainly serve as a hub for exercises and materials to support my husband as he studies English and
    to supplement the skills he learns.
The website is divided into sections based on the four big skills--reading, writing, listening, and speaking--
    as well as three other relevant areas, pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar.
My ultimate goal for the website as of 5/2/23 is to populate the site with exercises and materials organized by
    a tag system. A single exercise that covers reading, writing, and vocabulary would be tagged with those three
    skills. When the user navigates to a skill's section, they see the exercises and materials tagged with that skill.
It ain't much, but it's honest work.
